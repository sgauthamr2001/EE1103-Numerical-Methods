# Integration 

Integrate the same dataset used for interpolation and compare the trapezoid rule against the more advanced Romberg Quadrature ([C code Implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method))

Use this for practice: Numerically integrate these functions

1. f(x) = exp(-x)*pow(cos(x),2) between 0 and pi
2. g(x) = cos(2*acos(x)) between -1 and 1

Use the three different method (midpoint, trapezoid and Simpson's) and compare the convergence of your integral for different step sizes
