Assignment

1. Take two inputs from the command line (N and distribution_name), generate N random numbers, and determine their histogram (graphical representation of their proability distribution)
2. Plot the distribution of random numbers for each of the 3 distributions. The links above have some codes. 
3. For extra credit - tabulate the results of the NIST randomness tests for each of the 4 distributions
4. You are required to upload one *.c and one *.pdf file

The learning objectives here are

1. To understand the different types of probability distributions that we encounter in engineering i.e. Normal (or Gaussian), Rayleigh, Lorentizan.
2. Learn how to use available codes - download, compile and run a suite of tests
3. Plotting using gnuplot
