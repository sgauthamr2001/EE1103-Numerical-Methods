# Distributions 

1. Take two inputs from the command line (N and distribution_name), generate N random numbers, and determine their histogram (graphical representation of their proability distribution)
2. Plot the distribution of random numbers for each of the 3 distributions. The links above have some codes. 
3. For extra credit - tabulate the results of the NIST randomness tests for each of the 4 distributions
4. You are required to upload one *.c and one *.pdf file.
