    On average, the surface area A of human beings is related to weight W and height H. Measurements on a number of individuals give values of A in the following table:  
    
    H(cm) 182 180 179 187 189 194 195 193 200  
    W(kg) 74 88 94 78 84 98 76 86 96  
    A (m2) 1.92 2.11 2.15 2.02 2.09 2.31 2.02 2.16 2.31  

    Develop an equation to predict area as a function of height and weight. Use it to estimate the surface area for a 187-cm, 78-kg person.
